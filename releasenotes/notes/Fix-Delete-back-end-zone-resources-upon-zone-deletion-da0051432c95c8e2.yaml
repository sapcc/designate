    Currently designate does not provide zone specific option to delete the
    zone resources (such as files) on the back-end (e.g. bind9) when the zone
    is deleted. To fix this add a header ``x-designate-hard-delete`` which will
    be used in the zone delete API to delete zone files on the back-end. This
    is in addition to the existing per-pool configration option that will
    override this new header option. This option is restricted for admin.
